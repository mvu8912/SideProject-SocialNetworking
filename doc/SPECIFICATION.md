Software Design Specification (SDS) Document
============================================

Project Title: CommunityConnect Social Networking System
--------------------------------------------------------

### 1\. Introduction

1.1 Purpose\
The purpose of this document is to outline the design and architecture of the CommunityConnect Social Networking System based on the requirements specified in the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document. This includes design goals, system architecture, data design, interface design, and procedural design.

1.2 Scope\
This document covers the design principles, architecture, and various components essential for the development and deployment of the CommunityConnect Social Networking System.

### 2\. Design Goals

2.1 User-Centric Design\
Ensure a user-friendly interface that allows for intuitive navigation and interaction within the platform.

2.2 Scalability\
Design the system to handle a growing number of users and data with minimal performance degradation.

2.3 Security\
Ensure the secure handling and storage of user data, and secure communication between users.

2.4 Performance\
Ensure fast response times and real-time updates for a seamless user experience.

2.5 Maintainability\
Design for easy updates, bug fixes, and the addition of new features in the future.

### 3\. System Architecture

3.1 Client-Server Architecture\
Employ a client-server architecture with a web-based client interface and a server hosting the backend services and databases.

3.2 Microservices Architecture\
Decompose the backend into microservices for easier scaling, maintenance, and updates.

### 4\. Data Design

4.1 Database Schema\
Design a normalized relational database schema to store user profiles, posts, messages, and other relevant data.

4.2 Data Privacy and Encryption\
Employ encryption techniques for sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

### 5\. Interface Design

5.1 User Interface (UI)

-   Admin Module:
    -   Dashboard for user and content management.
    -   Interface for broadcasting announcements.
-   Participant Module:
    -   Registration and login pages.
    -   Profile management interface.
    -   Social interaction and messaging interfaces.
    -   Information tracking sections.

5.2 Application Programming Interface (API)\
Design RESTful APIs to enable communication between the client and server, ensuring a clear contract and versioning for future compatibility.

### 6\. Procedural Design

6.1 Authentication and Authorization\
Implement OAuth 2.0 or similar protocols for secure authentication and authorization.

6.2 Error Handling and Logging\
Design robust error handling and logging mechanisms to aid in troubleshooting and system monitoring.

6.3 Testing Procedures\
Outline procedures for unit, integration, and system testing to ensure the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
